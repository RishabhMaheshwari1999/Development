Note :
*  1 . when space is used then it means that it will go in each particular sections
*  2 . when dot is used its generally means for class and if we have two class in some tags then if we write 
        for example .c1 "space" .c2 it means that it will gonna search in all the dom tree and will file that particular
        class (.c1) and the it will search (.c2)
        where as if we write for example .c1.c2 it means its gonna search for both class at same time and it should be
        present as "c1 c2"
*  3.  when # is used its for id which is unique
*  4.  when > is used its for descendent ( means it will find all those who are the first child and other than that and we can't used double arrow).
*  5.  when we create something user defined identification then we have to use square brackets [].
